•	Many asymptotic methods have been developed to model electromagnetic scattered fields by canonical and complex targets. The asymptotic methods such as Geometrical Optics (GO), Physical Optic (PO), Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), Physical Theory of Diffraction (PTD) and Equivalent Current Method (ECM) are considered as high frequencies approximation. However; the critical points of some asymptotic methods are related to the transaction between highlighted and shadowed region and the caustic problem.
